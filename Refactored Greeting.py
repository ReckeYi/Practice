Refactored Greeting

DESCRIPTION:
The following code could use a bit of object-oriented artistry. While it's a simple method and works just fine as it is, in a larger system it's best to organize methods into classes/objects. (Or, at least, something similar depending on your language)

Refactor the following code so that it belongs to a Person class/object. Each Person instance will have a greet method. The Person instance should be instantiated with a name so that it no longer has to be passed into each greet method call.

Here is how the final refactored code would be used:

joe = Person('Joe')
joe.greet('Kate') # should return 'Hello Kate, my name is Joe'
joe.name          # should == 'Joe'

# TODO: This method needs to be called multiple times for the same person (my_name).
# It would be nice if we didnt have to always pass in my_name every time we needed to great someone.
"""

# My solution
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def greet(self, your_name):
        return f"Hello {your_name}, my name is {self.name}"

Best Practices

#1
class Person:

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self, your_name):
        return "Hello {you}, my name is {me}".format(you=your_name, me=self.name)
        
#2
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def greet(self, other):
        return f"Hello {other}, my name is {self.name}"
